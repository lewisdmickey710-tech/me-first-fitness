-- Web push subscriptions -- one row per device/browser that's opted in.
-- Keyed by auth user id rather than client_id, since the coach subscribes
-- too and there's no "clients" row for her. Sending always goes through
-- the admin client server-side (RLS bypassed), so the only policy needed
-- is "a signed-in user manages their own rows" -- for subscribing,
-- unsubscribing, and letting a device see whether it's already subscribed.
